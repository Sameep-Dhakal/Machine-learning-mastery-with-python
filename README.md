# Machine-learning-mastery-with-python
In this repository you can see the coding examples form book machine learning mastery with python by Jason Brownlee



# A predictive machine learning can be broken down into 6 parts.
1. Define Problem: Investigate and characterize the problem in order to better understand
the goals of the project.
2. Analyze Data: Use descriptive statistics and visualization to better understand the data
you have available.
3. Prepare Data: Use data transforms in order to better expose the structure of the
prediction problem to modeling algorithms.
4. Evaluate Algorithms: Design a test harness to evaluate a number of standard algorithms
on the data and select the top few to investigate further.
5. Improve Results: Use algorithm tuning and ensemble methods to get the most out of
well-performing algorithms on your data.
6. Present Results: Finalize the model, make predictions and present results.
